# üîÑ NeuroSync: Delay the Dopamine, Hack Your Habits 

This Dopamine Delay System is a comprehensive digital wellness application designed to help users manage their screen time and build healthier digital habits. It combines behavioral psychology principles with gamification to create a system that delays access to distracting websites while providing alternative productive activities.

## Core Concept

The app is built around the concept of "dopamine delay" - instead of immediately accessing potentially addictive websites, users must complete meaningful challenges that promote mindfulness, learning, and well-being. This creates a friction barrier that encourages more intentional internet usage.

Ô∏è ## Application Architecture
